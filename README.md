## Contexts

### Technology and Computing
In software development, a hypermodular architecture would allow for easier updates, maintenance, and scale, as individual modules or components can be modified or replaced without impacting the entire system.

### Manufacturing and Industry
Hypermodular design in manufacturing processes or equipment can enable factories to quickly adapt to new product lines or changes in demand by reconfiguring modular components.

### Urban Design and Architecture
Hypermodularity in urban design might involve the creation of living spaces or structures that can be quickly assembled, disassembled, and reassembled in different configurations depending on the changing needs of the inhabitants.

### Organizational Structures
In management, a hypermodular organizational structure would reflect a highly flexible and adaptable model where teams or units can be formed, reformed, and disbanded as needed to respond to various projects and challenges.



## Hypermodularity in Science

Hypermodularity refers to an extreme degree of modularity, characterized by highly interconnected but independent units or modules. 
This concept can be applied to various fields, ranging from natural systems to technology and science. 
Let's explore how hypermodularity manifests across these different areas:

1. **Nature:**
   - In ecology, hypermodularity can be seen in ecosystems, where a diverse range of species and habitats interact but also function independently. Food webs are an example, where each species may play a distinct role, but the removal or addition of one species can have ripple effects through the system.
   - In biology, the concept of hypermodularity can be seen in the organization of cells and organs within an organism. Cells are self-contained units that can independently perform specific functions yet are part of larger biological systems.

2. **Technology:**
   - In software engineering, hypermodularity is the backbone of microservices architecture, where applications are structured as collections of loosely coupled services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
   - In hardware, we see hypermodularity in computer design, such as the standardized interfaces allowing components like RAM, hard drives, and processors to be swapped and upgraded with ease.

3. **Medicine:**
   - In medical treatment, hypermodularity can apply to personalized medicine, where treatments are tailored to individual patients. Different modules (e.g., medications, physical therapies, and surgical interventions) can be combined to address a patient's specific health concerns.
   - Prosthetics and implants are physically modular, designed to integrate with the human body. They can be mixed and matched to meet the specific needs of different patients.

4. **Chemistry:**
   - Hypermodularity is inherent in supramolecular chemistry, where molecules form complex structures through non-covalent bonds. These structures can be thought of as modules that assemble into larger systems.
   - Polymer chemistry also uses a modular approach, with monomers serving as building blocks that can be assembled into various polymers with different properties and applications.

5. **Physics:**
   - In condensed matter physics, the concept of modularity is seen in crystallography, where the repeating unit cell acts as the basic module for the entire crystal structure.
   - In particle physics, the Standard Model is a hypermodular framework where particles and forces are seen as separate modules that interact according to specific principles.

Overall, hypermodularity allows for complexity within a system while maintaining a level of simplicity, adaptability, and robustness in individual components. 
For example, in technology, it facilitates innovation as new modules can be added or updated without overhauling entire systems. 
In nature, it enables resilience, as systems can adapt to changes by reorganizing modular connections. 
In science, it helps to understand complex structures by studying their individual modules. 
Hypermodularity, when implemented thoughtfully, can therefore contribute to efficiency, flexibility, and sustainability across multiple fields.



## Use Cases

from cosmic ideas to management ... 

### HD-SSP Space Solar Power

+ HD-SSP [Hypermodular Distributed Space Solar Power](https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/doc/nrg/SPS%202013/EXT-RPR-1309%20Martin%20Leitgeber%20-%20IAC_SSP_Competition_2013_final092213.pdf)

Hypermodularity is an attractive principle for space solar power architecture, as e.g. recently used in Ref. [5].
By assembling full SSP stations from a large amount of identical elements, production cost are significantly de-creased and reliability of the system is increased due to fewer single points of failure



### Modular edge computing

By combining that 3 layers: **hardware**, software with network of **services** and **data**, can be achieved modular edge computing:
